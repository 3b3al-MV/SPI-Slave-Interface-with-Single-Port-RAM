# SPI Slave Interface with Single Port RAM

This Verilog project implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) slave interface with a single-port RAM. It also includes a testbench for simulation and verification purposes.

## Overview

The SPI slave interface is a widely used communication protocol for connecting microcontrollers and peripheral devices. In this project, we implement an SPI slave interface in Verilog and a single-port RAM for data storage.

## Features

- **SPI Slave Interface:** Implements SPI communication protocol in Verilog.
- **Single Port RAM:** Provides a simple single-port RAM for data storage.
- **Testbench:** Includes a testbench for simulation and verification of the SPI slave interface and single-port RAM functionality.



## File Structure

- **SPI.v/:** Contains SPI main source file.
- **RAM.v/:** Contains the single port RAM code
- **SPI_Wrapper.v/:** Instantiates both of the above in a single wrapper
- **testbench/:** Contains testbench files for simulation.
- **docs/:** Additional documentation files if any.
